# GitHub Repository Setup

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `bizmap`
4. Description: `Business location finder`
5. Make it Public (so Netlify can access it)
6. DON'T check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
7. DON'T check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Get Repository URL

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you a page with commands. Copy the HTTPS URL that looks like:
```
https://github.com/yourusername/bizmap.git
```

## Step 3: Push Your Code

Once you have the URL, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/bizmap.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 4: Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up or login (free)
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Choose GitHub and authorize Netlify
5. Select your "bizmap" repository
6. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/dist`
7. Click "Deploy site"

## Step 5: Get Your Live URL
